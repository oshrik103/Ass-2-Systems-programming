BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

A.
we simply used all of the varribles that were defined in the config file in each place that we needed to use them instead of using magic
numbers, about the hints varrible we printed the hints to the console (using the hints method) in the placeCardsOnTable method,
only if the table has changed and if the hints boolean was true 

B. configurations like TurnTimeoutSeconds,TurnTimeoutWarningSeconds,PointFreezeSeconds,PenaltyFreezeSeconds were mostly used in
updateTimerDisplay (dealer), sleepUntilWokenOrTimeout (dealer), point (dealer and player), penalty (dealer and player).
hints was used in  placeCardsOnTable (dealer). TableDelaySeconds was used in placeCard and removeCard (table).

C. we tested it by changing those values in the config properties file, and checking if the game's settings and ui were changed
respectively.
--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

A. 
we created only the players' threads in the run of dealer in the order of their ids in the player array,
and we used the player terminate method to interrupt each of those in the dealer terminate method, going through the player array
in a reverse order this time to destroy the players' threads in reverse order 

B. 
creating the threads - in the run of dealer
terminating the threads - the terminate method of dealer called the terminate method of player that interrupted the thread.

c.
We saw that all threads were indeed terminated in the log, even though it does not print it
in the reverse order accurately because we know that the scheduler might stop one thread's run and move to another one
before that the destroy message was printed to the log 
--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
